### 2.1 Agents and Environments
- **Agent** is anything that perceiving the **environment** through its **sensors** and acting upon its **actuators**
- Percept sequence is an agent's history of percepts (its perceptual inputs)
- Mathematically speaking, **agent function** takes percept sequence as input and returns an action as output
- agent function is abstract, **agent program** is a concrete implementation

### 2.2 The concept of rationality
- **Rational agent** takes percept sequence as input and returns the action that maximizes its **performance measure**
- rationality maximizes expected performance
